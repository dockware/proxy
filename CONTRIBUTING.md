## How to contribute?
Dockware is built with Orca (www.orca-build.io).

Please use the provided `makefile` to install dependencies, and to generate
the Dockerfiles for building and testing.

If you create new features and changes, please always keep in mind, where to add
your modifications. 

If you want to create features for all images and tags, then use the global template.
Otherwise please add your changes in either the corresponding image or even on a "tag" level.
